# BarnettProject

This repository contains code and data for a project conducted at the Barnett Institute focused on analyzing protein complexes and gene membership across various tissue types. The goal is to characterize how gene composition of biological complexes varies in a tissue-specific manner, enabling insights into protein complex regulation, tissue function, and disease mechanisms.

## Project Overview

- **Focus**: Tissue-specific analysis of gene membership within protein complexes
- **Scope**: Comparative analysis across multiple tissue types using publicly available data from the Slavov Lab
